## CSS Conventions

tome's CSS follows a convention that I call PCCM. Which stands for:

* Prefix
* Component
* Child
* Modifier

Take, for instance, this CSS class:

> js-profileBanner_header--transparent

In this case:

* "js" is the prefix
* "profileBanner" is the component
* "header" is the child
* "transparent" is the modifier

### Prefix

### Component

### Child

### Modifier
